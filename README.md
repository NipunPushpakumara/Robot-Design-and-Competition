# Robot-Design-and-Competition

This repository encompasses the resources pertaining to the semester 3 module EN2533: Robot Design and Competition.

The module's competition structure comprised two distinct tasks: a Simulation Task and a Physical Task.

Simulation Task
Within the realm of the simulation task, participants were tasked with conceptualizing a virtual robot utilizing the Webots Open-Source Simulator (version R2021b). The performance evaluation of the virtual robot transpired across three fundamental tasks:

Line Following: The virtual robot was required to meticulously trail a white line on a black surface, encompassing both linear and curved segments.

Segmented Wall Following: The virtual robot's journey necessitated the pursuit of a segmented wall distinguished by diverse shapes, encompassing both straight and curved segments.

Chessboard Area Exploration: Assuming the role of a black rook in a game of chess, the virtual robot's primary objective was to execute checkmate in a solitary move. Upon achieving this feat, the robot gained the freedom to explore the confines of the chessboard arena and undertake supplementary tasks.

The virtual robot's successful completion of these tasks hinged upon adherence to meticulously outlined simulation specifications, inclusive of authentic sensor and actuator configurations.

Physical Task
Transitioning to the physical task, the emphasis rested upon a robot constructed in accordance with specific robotic specifications. This physical robot underwent rigorous testing across three distinct subtasks:

Line Maze Exploration: The robot's journey commenced from an initial square within a maze devoid of loops, restricted to 90-degree turns. The objective was to navigate the maze until reaching a white checkpoint square located on the opposing side. Evaluation criteria included the expeditious return to the starting square via the shortest viable path.

Curved Wall Following: Following the successful completion of the line maze, the robot confronted the challenge of adhering to a curved wall without traversing a red demarcation. The ultimate objective was to reach a blind box entrance positioned at the termination of the wall.

Blind Box Navigation: Within the confines of the blind box, equipped with three openings - an entrance, an incorrect exit, and the correct exit - the robot was tasked with selecting the correct exit route. Upon exit, the robot had to track a line, ultimately arriving at its designated final destination square.

Evaluation of the physical robot's performance centered on the precision and efficiency exhibited throughout the course of these tasks.

Kindly note that detailed task elaborations are readily accessible within the repository, providing comprehensive insights into the intricacies of each task.
